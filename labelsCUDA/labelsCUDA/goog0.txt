Google Search or Google Web Search is a web search engine owned by Google Inc. and is the most-used search engine on the Web.[3] Google receives several hundred million queries each day through its various services.[4] The main purpose of Google Search is to hunt for text in webpages, as opposed to other data, such as with Google Image Search. Google search was originally developed by Larry Page and Sergey Brin in 1997.[5]
Google Search provides more than 22 special features beyond the original word-search capability.[6] These include synonyms, weather forecasts, time zones, stock quotes, maps, earthquake data, movie showtimes, airports, home listings, and sports scores. (see below: Special features). There are special features for numbers including prices, temperatures, money/unit conversions ("10.5 cm in inches"), calculations ( 3*4+sqrt(6)-pi/2 ), package tracking, patents, area codes,[6] and rudimentary language translation of displayed pages.
The order of search results on Google's search-results pages is based on a priority rank called a "PageRank". Google Search provides many options for customized search (see below: Search options), such as: exclusion ("-xx"), inclusion ("+xx"), alternatives ("xx OR yy"), and wildcard ("x * x").[7]
